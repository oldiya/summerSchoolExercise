# GROUP1

## Tasks
The group should answer 4 questions during the exercises (A-D). 
Questions A-B addressing process-based modeling for Plot1, C-D addressing empirical modeling for Bryophites species using GLMs.
Four sub-groups should be formed inside the group addressing 1-1 questions.


### Subgroup A:

Question to address: How are biodiversity indices changing in time and across the simulated scenario(s) on Plot 1?

General tasks:

1. Get familiar with the model @sec-iland
2. Get start with the exercise @sec-gs
3. Get familiar with the input files @sec-in
4. Run the model and check the outputs @sec-run + @sec-out
5. Run alternative scenario @sec-as

Question-specific tasks:

6. Open R project file and open a new script and save it into your "code" folder, here you can start to work
7. Load the output files into R and read in the *tree* output table from the sqlite files both for reference simulations and scenario run(s) (@sec-A_1.1)
8. Study the output table and do some visualizations, e.g. plot the trees by locations in year=0 and year=100 coloring by species and making different size of circles based on dbh and compare reference and scenario runs! (@sec-A_1.2)
9. Plot the time development of some variables (e.g. average dbh of the trees) and compare reference and scenario runs! (@sec-A_1.3)
10. Study how biodiversity changed over time during your simulations and compare reference and scenario runs:

** Here you can address species diversity based Shannon index using the *adiv* R package speciesdiV() function  (@sec-A_1.4)
** You can address structural diversity using Francesco's R package *treespat* R package that you can install via devtools (@sec-A_1.5)

```{r ex1, eval=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
devtools::install_gitlab('fchianucci/treespat')
```
For example, these two:

DIFF, Diameter differentiation (Gadow, 1993): Spatial size inequality defined as the mean of the ratio of smaller and larger plant sizes in the nearest neighbors of a tree.
The value of the index increases with increasing average size difference between neighboring trees. 0 is implying that
neighboring trees have equal size.

MING, Mingling (Aguirre et al., 2003): One very intuitive extension of taxonomic species diversity (either richness or abundance) is considering spatial
mingling, namely how plants of the same (con-specific neighbors) or different (hetero-specific neighbors) species are arranged in space.
The mingling index calculates the proportion of the k nearest neighbors that do not belong to the same species as the reference tree.
For example, with four neighbors, the mingling attribute can assume five values, ranging from 0 (all trees are of the same species) to 1 (all trees belong to different species).

** ..or feel free to use any of the tools that you know or learnt during this week.

Note: you can find R package documentation in the *documents* folder
Compare the development of biodiversity indices in time for the reference and scenario runs.


### Subgroup B:

Question to address: How are the species distribution and total living biomass C content changing in time on Plot 1? Compare 0 year and 100 year status in the reference case and in the case of your scenario(s)!

General tasks:

1. Get familiar with the model @sec-iland
2. Get start with the exercise @sec-gs
3. Get familiar with the input files @sec-in
4. Run the model and check the outputs @sec-run + @sec-out
5. Run alternative scenario @sec-as


Question-specific tasks:

6. Open R project file and open a new script and save it into your "code" folder, here you can start to work.
7. Load the output files into R and read in the *landscape* output table from the sqlite files both for reference simulations and scenario run(s) (@sec-B_1.1)
8. Visualize model results for both reference and scenarios run(s) using the species specific outputs, for example total_carbon_kg (carbon content of living compartments) and count_ha (number of trees). You can also plot e.g. mean dbh change per species, or anything that you think is interesting @sec-B_1.2
9. Calculate the carbon content of living compartments of the trees in year=0 and year=100 and compare them between different model runs.  @sec-B_1.3
10. Study the species composition change based on carbon content, or volume. Which species remained there, disappeared of increased on decreased their proportions. @sec-B_1.4


### Subgroup C:
Question to address: Does a more diverse forest in structure and composition have more Bryophites species? 

... steps...


### Subgroup D:
Question to address: Is the number of Bryophites species affected by forest management type and the forest structural diversity? 

... steps...
