# Forest modeling exercise project folder

These are the materials for the [interdisciplinary summer school on forest ecosystems](https://3dforecotech.eu/activities/training-schools/interdisciplinary-summer-school-on-forest-ecosystems-technologies-biodiversity-modelling/) for the forest modeling exercise #SuperSummerSchool 



In this project you will find the following folders and files:

* `summerSchoolExercise.Rproj`: this is the project file that you should open. This file contains various project options and is used as a shortcut for opening the project directly from the file system.
*  `code`: where you should save the R scripts . 
*  `data`: the folder where you will add the data used in the empirical modeling. You can find instructions of how to download this file in the README.md file inside this folder.
*  `instructions`:  where you can find the pdf and qmd with the step by step instructions for the exercises without the solutions,  and all the extensions and images needed to compile the document
*  `model`:  where you wil add the folder `iLand_simulations` with all the files needed to run the process based exercise. You can find instructions of how to download this file in the README.md file inside this folder.
*  `solutions`:  where you can find this document in pdf and in the qmd and all the extensions and images needed to compile the documentOur recommendation is that you follow this folder structure and that you use the `summerSchoolExercise.Rproj` to open Rstudio.  If you decide to organize things in a different way then you will have to change all the relative paths in the codes provided in the solutions documentation.
