# General

This document is the step by step guide. You will now find a set of instructions for your group.

To do this exercise you first need to download the project folder. You can download the complete project folder from [this link:](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1IXfJNIXw32lp1q4AmEZzt0nqgE3HDRIx)

<https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1IXfJNIXw32lp1q4AmEZzt0nqgE3HDRIx>.

In this project folder you will find the following folders and files:

-   `summerSchoolExercise.Rproj`: this is the project file that you should open. This file contains various project options and is used as a shortcut for opening the project directly from the file system.
-   `code`: where you should save the R scripts.
-   `data`: this folder contains the data used in the empirical modeling.
-   `instructions`: where you can find the pdf and qmd with the step by step instructions for the exercises without the solutions, and all the extensions and images needed to compile the document.
-   `model`: where you will find the folder `iLand_simulations` with all the files needed to run the process based exercise
-   `solutions`: where you can find this document in pdf and in the qmd and all the extensions and images needed to compile the document

Our recommendation is that you follow this folder structure and that you use the `summerSchoolExercise.Rproj` to open Rstudio. If you decide to organize things in a different way then you will have to change all the relative paths in the codes provided in the solutions documentation. The folder you have downloaded should look like this:

![](images/folderStrucComplete.png){width="300"}

This project is also available in a github repository. You can clone the project in [here:](https://github.com/oldiya/summerSchoolExercise)

<https://github.com/oldiya/summerSchoolExercise>

Please notice that in the github project the data file `data/observations.csv` and the folder `model/iLand_simulations` are missing and have to be downloaded separately (read the README.md files in these folders to learn how to download them).

Please, also be aware of data and model policy, you can read it [following this link](https://ites-fe.ethz.ch/rws/SS/exerciseSolutions.html#sec-policy).

# GROUP1

# GROUP4

## Tasks

The group should answer 4 questions during the exercises (A-D). Questions A-B addressing Plot 4, C-D addressing empirical modeling for the presence of the Eurasian treecreeper using Boosted Regression Trees. You should form four sub-groups of 3-4 people inside the group to address each of the questions.

## Subgroup A \[Process Based\]

### Question to address

How are biodiversity indices changing in time and across the simulated scenario(s) on Plot 4?

7.  Process model outputs [\[click here\]](https://ites-fe.ethz.ch/rws/SS/exerciseSolutions.html#sec-out):

<!-- -->

a.  Open R project file and open a new script and save it into your "code" folder, here you can start to work
b.  Load the output files into R and read in the *tree* output table from the sqlite files both for reference simulations and scenario run(s) [\[for help click here\]](https://ites-fe.ethz.ch/rws/SS/exerciseSolutions.html#sec-A_4.1)
c.  Study the output table and do some visualizations, e.g. plot the trees by locations in year=0 and year=100 coloring by species and making different size of circles based on dbh and compare reference and scenario runs [\[for help click here\]](https://ites-fe.ethz.ch/rws/SS/exerciseSolutions.html#sec-A_4.2)
d.  Plot the time development of some variables (e.g. average dbh of the trees) and compare reference and scenario runs [\[for help click here\]](https://ites-fe.ethz.ch/rws/SS/exerciseSolutions.html#sec-A_4.3)
e.  Study how biodiversity changed over time during your simulations and compare reference and scenario runs. You can use species diversity index ([for help click here](https://ites-fe.ethz.ch/rws/SS/exerciseSolutions.html#sec-A_4.4)), and also some structural diversity indices for which you can get familiar with Francesco's R package "treespat" ([for help click here](https://ites-fe.ethz.ch/rws/SS/exerciseSolutions.html#sec-A_1.5)) You can find R package documentation in the *documents* folder

## Subgroup B \[Process Based\]

### Question to address

How are the species distribution and total living biomass C content changing in time on Plot 4? Compare 0 year and 100 year status in the reference case and in the case of your scenario(s).
